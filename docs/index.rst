   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Toil
====

Toil is a workflow engine entirely written in Python. It features:

* Easy installation, e.g. ``pip install toil``.

* `Common Workflow Language`_ (`CWL`_) support
  
  Complete support for the 3.0 CWL specification, allowing it to execute
  CWL workflows.
  
* `Workflow Description Language`_ (`WDL`_) support
  
  Draft support for the WDL specification, allowing it to execute
  WDL workflows.
  
* Cross platform support 
  
  Develop and test on your laptop then deploy on any of the following:
  
  - Commercial clouds
    + `Amazon Web Services`_ (including the `spot market`_)
    + `Microsoft Azure`_
  - Private clouds
    + `OpenStack`_
  - High Performance Computing Environments
    + `GridEngine`_
    + `Apache Mesos`_
    + `Parasol`_
    + Individual multi-core machines

* A small API 
  
  Easily mastered, the Python user API for defining and running workflows is built upon one core class.
       
* Complete file and stream management:
   
  Temporary and persistent file management that abstracts the details of the
  underlying file system, providing a uniform interface regardless of
  environment. Supports both atomic file transfer and streaming interfaces, and
  provides encryption of user data.
   
* Scalability:

  Toil can easily handle workflows concurrently using hundreds of nodes and
  thousands of cores.

* Robustness:

  Toil workflows support arbitrary worker and leader failure, with strong
  check-pointing that always allows resumption.

* Efficiency:

  Caching, fine grained, per task, resource requirement specifications, and
  support for the AWS spot market mean workflows can be executed with little
  waste.

* Declarative and dynamic workflow creation:

  Workflows can be declared statically, but new jobs can be added dynamically
  during execution within any existing job, allowing arbitrarily complex
  workflow graphs with millions of jobs within them.

* Support for databases and services:

  For example, Apache Spark clusters can be created in seconds and easily
  integrated within a toil workflow as a service, with precisely defined time
  start and end times that fits with the flow of other jobs in the workflow.

* Open Source: An Apache license allows unrestricted use, incorporation and modification.
