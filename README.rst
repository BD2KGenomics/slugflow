Toil is a scalable, efficient, cross-platform pipeline management system,
written entirely in Python, and designed around the principles of functional
programming. Full documentation for the latest stable release can be found at
`Read the Docs`_.

I found a typo toil-sort-example.py:162 at `Typo`_. 'make_file_to_srt' should be 'make_file_to_sort'
